# FTSE-250-stock
This project was done for the Time Series module of my master's program. 
The objective was based on FTSE 250 stock. I examined the stationarity 
and I did a comparative analysis in the R environment, using ARMA-GARCH 
and an extension of Garch models in order to determine which model is better for this stock.
